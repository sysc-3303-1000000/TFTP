    Added: Code to make the write request completely finish before killing
    the ConnectionManager thread off.
    
    Need to change read to do the same

Date:   Thu May 22 21:28:35 2014 -0400

    Added functionality when last packet is delivered and closes the
    connection manager thread for ErrorSim. This is under normal operation.

Date:   Thu May 22 20:56:39 2014 -0400

    Added: fully working client UI, changes to client to run as a thread,
    and to send packet back and forth to connectionmanagerESim. Changed
    Server to only have one folder which can be read from.

Date:   Wed May 21 22:35:47 2014 -0400

    Added: Full UI for user to select read or write, locate directory and
    file. Added so when reading a file from the server, user can only
    navigate in the server directory for the file. ClientUI will be the
    "main" client program, which will spawn threads of type client in order
    to service the users demands. If the client UI is terminated, the client
    thread will still finish what it is doing before ending, this way we can
    ensure read and write operations will finish even if the client is
    shutdown. A file called SingleRootFileSystemView.java has also been
    added, for ensuring user can only select files from the designated
    server folder when reading from the server.
    
    TODO: Comment all code and implement Client to extend thread, and take
    information from ClientUI to perform operations

commit 4c3d31223cdbb82db127237ac86b074498643475
Author: happytimes123 <azn_pride108@hotmail.com>
Date:   Wed May 21 20:59:04 2014 -0400

    Updated the following in the ErrorSim:
    1) Cleaned up the print information formatting
    2) Added the user interface to select which option they want to operate
    the ErrorSim in
    3) Implemented the different operation modes (Lost, Delayed, Duplicated)
    4) Modified the run method in the ConnectionManagerESim to clean up the
    Normal operation
    5) Changed the SERVER_PORT to use the port 69 at the initial request and
    then the server port that it received the packet from
    
    KNOWN ISSUES:
    1) Shut down only works at the beginning. This is due to the user input
    only working at the beginning of the ErrorSim creation. Will update this
    to have it ask for the user input at each new request
